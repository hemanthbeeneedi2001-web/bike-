Description
Problem Description Write a Java program to simulate a ride-sharing system. Define an abstract class Ride with fields for driver name, vehicle number, distance, and an abstract method calculateFare(). Create subclasses BikeRide and CarRide where fare is calculated as distance × 10 for bike rides and distance × 20 for car rides. Read the ride type (bike or car) and distance from the user, then display driver details, vehicle number, distance, and fare. Use encapsulation for driver/vehicle details and inheritance for ride types. Handle invalid ride types using a custom exception. Input Format: First line: Ride type (bike or car) Second line: Distance in kilometers (double) Output Format: First line: Driver: <driverName> Second line: Vehicle No: <vehicleNumber> Third line: Distance: <distance> km Fourth line: Fare: ₹<calculated fare> Constraints: Distance > 0 Ride type = bike or car
